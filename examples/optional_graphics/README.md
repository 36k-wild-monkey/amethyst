## Optional graphics

This example shows how to easily write an app that can be ran in both graphic and non-graphic mode, with the decision
delegated to the code based on whether "empty" was used as a feature. Handy for applications which want to support
raw-console mode.

It borrows most of the code from [window](../window) example.
